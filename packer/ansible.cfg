# OpenSSH 8.8 disables RSA signatures that use the SHA-1 hash algorithm
# by default. Since this key type is used by Ansible when connecting to the
# remote instance we must add it to the allowed algorithms. Please see the
# OpenSSH 8,8 release notes for more information:
# https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.8
# The following issues are related to Packer's auto-generated SSH key using a
# deprecated (disabled as of OpenSSH 8.8) key algorithm:
